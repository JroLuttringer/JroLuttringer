I am currentlly working on my Ph. D. funded by a governemental fellowship at the [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/), in the [Networks Teams](https://reseaux.icube.unistra.fr/en/index.php/Home) of the ICube laboratory. 

My work is on constrained path computation for large-scale Segment Routing domains (which lead to the BEST2COP algorithm).
I am also working on OPTIC, a way to mitigate the impact of hot-potato BGP routing on transit traffic and its P4 implementation. My work is supervised by Pr. Cristel Pelsser and Dr. Pascal Mérindol.

Besides my work on Segment Routing, I have also worked on Internet topology discovery, more precisely on hidden MPLS tunnels revelation in the wild and on large-scale multi-domain tunnels measurements (Geant GN4).

I have also taught ~ 192h in the past 3 years (and thoroughly enjoyed doing so!).
