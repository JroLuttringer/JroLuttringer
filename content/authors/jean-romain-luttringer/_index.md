I am a Ph.D. in Computer Networks currently working as a research and teaching assistant at the  [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/), in the [Networks Teams](https://reseaux.icube.unistra.fr/en/index.php/Home) of the ICube laboratory. 

My work focuses around routing. In particular, I worked on constrained path computation for large-scale Segment Routing domains. I am also working on OPTIC, a way to mitigate the impact of hot-potato BGP routing on transit traffic and its P4 implementation. 

Besides my work on routing, I have also worked on Internet topology discovery, more precisely on hidden MPLS tunnels revelation in the wild and on large-scale multi-domain tunnels measurements (Geant GN4).

I have also taught ~ 400h in the past 4 years (and thoroughly enjoyed doing so!).
