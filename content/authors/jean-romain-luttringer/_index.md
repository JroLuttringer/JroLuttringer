Welcome ! You should find all my info, posters, publications, presentations and courses on this website !

I am now working on my Ph. D. funded by a governemental fellowship at the University of Strasbourg, in the Networks Teams of the ICube laboratory. My work is on Segment Routing & path computation (which lead to the algorithm Best2Cop and its variants), and is supervised by Pr. Cristel Pelsser and Dr. Pascal Mérindol. I am also working on OPTIC, a way to mitigate the impact of hot-potation BGP routing on transit traffic. I also did several (2019/2020 - 2020/2021 - 2021-2022) complementary teaching activities.

Besides my work on Segment Routing, I also worked on Internet topology discovery, more precisely on hidden MPLS tunnels revelation in the wild and on large-scale multi-domain tunnels measurements (Geant GN4).
