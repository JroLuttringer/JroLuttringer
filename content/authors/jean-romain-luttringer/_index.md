I am currentlly working on my Ph. D. funded by a governemental fellowship at the University of Strasbourg, in the Networks Teams of the ICube laboratory. 

My work is on constrained path computation for large-scale Segment Routing domains.
I am also working on OPTIC, a way to mitigate the impact of hot-potato BGP routing on transit traffic and its P4 implementation. My work is supervised by Pr. Cristel Pelsser and Dr. Pascal Mérindol. 

Besides my work on Segment Routing, I have also worked on Internet topology discovery, more precisely on hidden MPLS tunnels revelation in the wild and on large-scale multi-domain tunnels measurements (Geant GN4).

I have also taught ~ 192h in the past 3 years (and thoroughly enjoyed doing so!).

Welcome ! You should find all my info, posters, publications, presentations and courses on this website !

I am now working on my Ph. D. funded by a governemental fellowship at the University of Strasbourg, in the Networks Teams of the ICube laboratory. My work is on Segment Routing & path computation (which lead to the algorithm Best2Cop and its variants), and is supervised by Pr. Cristel Pelsser and Dr. Pascal Mérindol. I am also working on OPTIC, a way to mitigate the impact of hot-potation BGP routing on transit traffic. I also did several (2019/2020 - 2020/2021 - 2021-2022) complementary teaching activities.

Besides my work on Segment Routing, I also worked on Internet topology discovery, more precisely on hidden MPLS tunnels revelation in the wild and on large-scale multi-domain tunnels measurements (Geant GN4).
